# Billing System Integration Based on Credits

To integrate a billing system based on credits for the multi-tenant system, follow these steps:

## Steps to Implement Credit-Based Billing

### 1. Define Credit System
- [x] **Determine Credit Allocation**: Define how credits are allocated and consumed.
- [ ] **Action-Based Consumption**: Specify actions that consume credits (e.g., API calls based on the tier of service).

### 2. Modify Database Schema
- [ ] **Add/Modify Tables**: Track credits for each tenant.
  - Columns: `total_credits`, `credits_used`, `remaining_credits`.

### 3. Update Authentication and Authorization
- [ ] **Credit Checks**: Ensure sufficient credits before allowing API access.
  - Implement middleware in your API to check tenant's credit balance.

### 4. API Key Management Updates
- [ ] **Include Credit Checks**: When allocating an API key, check if the tenant has enough credits.

### 5. Billing and Credit Allocation Service
- [ ] **Develop Service**: Handle credit purchases, allocation, and billing.
  - Interact with a payment gateway.
  - Update tenant's credit balance.

### 6. Usage Monitoring and Reporting
- [ ] **Monitor API Usage**: Report on credit consumption.
  - Admin dashboard for tenants to view credit usage and purchase additional credits.

### 7. Notifications and Alerts
- [ ] **Set Up Notifications**: Inform tenants about their credit balance.
  - Alerts for low credits or significant consumption.

### 8. Documentation and Support
- [ ] **Update Documentation**: Include information about the credit-based billing system.
  - Instructions for monitoring credit usage and purchasing more credits.

### 9. Testing and Deployment
- [ ] **Thorough Testing**: Ensure accurate tracking and billing for API usage.
  - Consider phased rollout to monitor impact.

### 10. Legal and Compliance
- [ ] **Review Compliance**: Ensure the billing system complies with financial regulations.
  - Update terms of service to reflect the new billing model.

## Middleware Pseudocode Outline


```js
AWS = require('aws-sdk');

// Assuming these functions are async and interact with AWS services or a database
async function getTenantIdFromRequest(event) {
  // Extract tenant ID from the Lambda event object
}

async function getApiKeyFromRequest(event) {
  // Extract API key from the Lambda event object
}

async function getRequiredCreditsForRequest(event) {
  // Determine required credits based on the event object
  return 1; // Placeholder value
}

async function getTenantCredits(tenantId, apiKey) {
  // Retrieve tenant's current credit balance from the database
  return 10; // Placeholder value
}

async function deductCredits(tenantId, credits) {
  // Deduct credits from the tenant's balance in the database
}

exports.handler = async (event) => {
  try {
    const tenantId = await getTenantIdFromRequest(event);
    const apiKey = await getApiKeyFromRequest(event);
    const requiredCredits = await getRequiredCreditsForRequest(event);

    const tenantCredits = await getTenantCredits(tenantId, apiKey);

    if (tenantCredits >= requiredCredits) {
      await deductCredits(tenantId, requiredCredits);
      // Proceed with the request
      return {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Request processed successfully." }),
      };
    } else {
      return {
        statusCode: 403,
        body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Insufficient credits" }),
      };
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    return {
      statusCode: 500,
      body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Internal server error" }),
    };
  }
};
```

This code snippet is a direct adaptation middleware for use in an AWS Lambda function. It assumes that you have functions to extract the tenant ID, API key, and required credits from the Lambda event object, which represents the HTTP request. The handler function is the entry point for the Lambda function, processing the incoming event and returning an appropriate response.

This approach general ensures that the system can manage API usage fairly across tenants, based on the credits they have purchased, aligning with the tiered multi-tenant strategy described in the README.const
